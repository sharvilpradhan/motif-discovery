# Motif Discovery using Multi-objective Optimization Heuristic Algorithms

## Description

Motif is a short region or subsequence of DNA or protein sequence that has a specific structure
and act as a candidate for functionally important sites.These motifs are useful for finding
Transcription Factor Binding Sites that are crucial for understanding the Genetic Regulatory
System. 
Heuristic algorithms have been implemented to find motifs while maximizing 3 objectives - motif length, motif similarity (consensus score) and surprise factor.

## What I learnt?
- Implementing heuristic algorithms to solve NP-complete problems
- Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm and Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA)
- Handling and manipulating large biological data
- Read and process FASTA file formats used in Bioinformatics
